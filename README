   libtransliterate


This library converts “transliterated” representations of non-English
languages, like TLG's Beta Code, to unicode. Supported
transliterations are:

o The Thesaurus Linguae Graecae’s Beta Code for Polytonic Greek,
  Hebrew and Coptic. 
o cjhebrew transliteration from the LaTeX package by that name

I don’t know much about Coptic, so the functions for that language
remain untested. The Beta Code representation for Hebrew does not
support vowel and diacritical marks by design, cjhebrew does.

The library comes with

o a swig interface definition that may work with your favorite
  scripting language
o and a hand-coded interface with native Python Unicode support (if
  your interpreter is built right, which is likely).

For documentation see transliteration.h. Just running

   make
   su make install
   
should give you a working library on MacOSX and Linux. It you're using
another system and get it to work I'd appreciate a patch. If you can't
get it to work or don't know how to, contact me and we'll try to
figure something out.
