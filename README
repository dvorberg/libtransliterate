   libtransliterate


This library converts “transliterated” representations of non-English
languages, that use sequences as ANSI characters to represent
characters, to unicode. Supported transliterations are:

o The Thesaurus Linguae Graecae’s Beta Code for Polytonic Greek,
  Hebrew and Coptic. 
o cjhebrew transliteration from the LaTeX package by that name

I don’t know much about Coptic, so the functions for that language
remain largely untested. The Beta Code representation for Hebrew is
missing vowel and diacritical marks entirely.

The library comes with

o a swig interface definition that may work with your favorite
  scripting language
o and a hand-coded Python interface with native Python Unicode
  support (if your interpreter is built right, which is likely).

For documentation see transliteration.h. Just running

   make
   su make install
   
should give you a working copy on MacOSX and Linux. It you're using
another system and get it to work I'd appreciate a patch. If you can't
get it to work or don't know how, don't hesitate to contact me.
