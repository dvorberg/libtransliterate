   libtransliterate


This library converts “transliterated” representations of non-English
languages, that use sequences as ANSI characters to represent
characters, to unicode. Supported transliterations are:

o The Thesaurus Linguae Graecae’s Beta Code for Polytonic Greek,
  Hebrew and Coptic. 
o cjhebrew transliteration from the LaTeX package by that name

I don’t know much about Coptic, so the functions for that language
remain largely untested. The Beta Code representation for Hebrew is
missing vowel and diacritical marks entirely.

The library comes with

o a swig interface definition that may work with your favorite
  scripting language
o and a hand-coded Python interface with native Python Unicode
  support (if your interpreter is built right, which is likely).

It has a BSD style license. See the LICENSE file.
